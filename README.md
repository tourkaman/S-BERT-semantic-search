# Semantic Search With Sentence-BERT
The goal of this project is to build a semantic search engine, using [S-BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084), after first implementing and evaluating it on the [STS benchmark](https://ixa2.si.ehu.eus/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark).

This is done as part of the second lab exercise in the course [ID2223 Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning](https://id2223kth.github.io) at [KTH](https://kth.se).

## Progress

So far we have only implemented the regression objective of the S-BERT paper, and evaluated it on the STS benchmark, using the `bert-base-uncased` pre-trained BERT model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co).
